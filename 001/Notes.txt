C Programming Language 

Computer - > Computational Device

4 Tasks:
- take input
- store data
- process information
- produce output

Computers perform instructions, that way they are helping in our thought process (Thinking)

How is it thinking or performing instructions?
Machine understands -> binary language -> 0 1 
instruction set  

a = 10
b = 5
c = a + b

10 is represented in binary like 1010
5 -> 101
+ -> 101000111000

1
add 1010  101
store res
0

mnemonics are invented -> Assembly language(AL)
If a program is written using mnemonics, then it is said to be written in AL
An assembler is used to convert AL -> ML(Machine Language)
C -> ML (compiler is the translator )

Day 2: Agenda For Today

1. The Need of Compiler!

Compiler -> is a program which translates source code written in HLL(high Level Language) into Machine Understandable Code

2. How Compiler Works?


We will talk about Functions 
-> starting with main()
-> Executed a Hello world Program which print hello Message in Different Languages
-> Return Type
-> IDE and CMD
-> Installing a Compiler and IDE

Use of IDEs, which to use and which one not to use?
> Structure of C Program
> Phases of Compilation

C Has Strong Roots in the In Industry
C is meant to build System Software - You will Have access to the Internals of the computer like Direct access to RAM, Processor Registers
A C program is much faster than a Python Or Java Program, because it is purely compiled and Platform Specific

We Discussed about What is Java and How we lead to Other aspects of Coding

NOTE: Tell Students about how OOP is Different from Procedural Programming Language. Should be able to tell in simple lay man terms

Show them the picture of Compiler 

The Process of Converting Source Code (written) in HLL to Target Machine Code is called Compilation.
Discuss about the Editor(Notepad) to write Code (instructions)
C program Source files are stored with .c Extension, Text files are stored with .txt extension

A Program Under Execution is called Process
