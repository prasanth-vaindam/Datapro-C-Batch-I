How many classes have been completed
----------
Student Replies: 
CLRSCR(), System("cls"), System("clear");
void main() why we have return statement at the end of the program.
Aryan came up with few programs for his exam,
Then we discussed if else and what a minimal condition looks like
few conditional expressions
i promised them i will conduct exam for them
after Naveen left for the day, i completed the isEven or Odd program to Aryan
i started with 2 table and also asked to write the first 5 even numbers
showed they are all multiples of 2 which means from other point they will be perfectly divisible by two
which means they will leave a reminder Zero on the other hand the numbers which are not divisible by 2 will leave a reminder 1
so % operator gives us these reminder values when we divide a number by 2
then I showed if else if else
--------------
I also showed turbo c compiler and explained why clrscr and getch() are used where these functions are present
i discussed greater than and less than example 
-----------
Agenda for tomorrow:
--------------------
is even or odd 
else if ladder
Grades of Student using Switch 

Zero is an even number. This is because an even number is any whole number that can be divided by 2 with no remainder, and \(0\div 2=0\). Zero is also an integer multiple of 2, as \(0=2\times 0\). Â
